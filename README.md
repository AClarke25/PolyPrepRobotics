# PolyPrepRobotics

This is the repository for the OFFICIAL Poly Prep robotics website, documenting the teams: The Blazing Bluebots and Polymorphism. As students graduate and new ones join the teams, new managers of the website can use this to easily commit changes, transfer access, and collaborate with multiple programmers at once. At the start of each robotics season, the minimum changes to be made to the website are: updating the current teammates listed on the "members" page, updating the MVPs on the "MVP" page (accessible through the "members" page) to be highlighted for their dedication and hard work, adding the new portfolio on the "portfolios" page, adding the new notebook on the "notebooks" page, and adding new photos on the "highlights" page. Some other changes that MAY OR MAY NOT need to be made are: rewriting the description of "Our Team" on the "home" page, updating the layout of the website if it is believed to be needed, adding the names of the contributors to the *footer* if the code of the website is manipulated, and making any changes in regards to team information if any new FTC teams are created under Poly robotics.

I believe that's it. Please keep the website up to date and happy coding!! :)
